GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control and collaboration for software development. 
It uses Git, an open-source version control system, to allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously and track changes to the code.
GitHub essentially acts as a social coding platform, facilitating collaboration and code management for software projects.
